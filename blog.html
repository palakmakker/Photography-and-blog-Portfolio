                                <p class = "blog-text">A lot of the time people who don't feel photogenic are already afraid of having their photograph taken, which then shows in their expression. Our job is to break down those barriers, help our subjects feel confident, and then find the angles, poses, and lighting to highlight that individual’s strengths.The recipe for a good portrait entails more than just photo and lighting gear. It starts with the photographer making a distinct effort to connect with the subject so they are at ease with the image-making process. This can often include advance research on your portrait subject and his or her interests—everything from familiarizing yourself with their passions to bring up as a conversation starter, to specific environmental factors, such as their favorite music playing in the studio to make them feel more relaxed during the shoot.

                                <p class = "blog-text">Architecture photography is a lot less dynamic than other photography fields. Especially compared to photojournalism or sports photography. You spend a considerable amount of time mulling over a scene or environment. This means your camera doesn’t need to focus on speed. Or continuous shooting modes, for example. You need to focus on quality. Use a low ISO, capture your images in Raw and utilize editing tools. With these, you are halfway to capturing stunning images .In architecture photography, you need to focus on composition rules a lot. A building can look stunning but if you don’t know how to fit it in your frame, it might look average in photos.
